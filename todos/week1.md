# Week 1

Date: 7/14 2022

Department: Contract

## TODOs

- [ ] Gain a decent understanding on Blender's python API.
- [ ] Find out a way to *possibly* create procedurally generated maps via noises, machine learning techniques and erosion simulations.
- [ ] Revisit smart contracts so that I won't forget about how to write Solidity codes.

## Reminders

- Noise functions tend to return evidently discrete values when invoked with integer values.
- As the density of vertices increases, the fabric effect poses a more significant influence on the object.
